## About Me
- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m currently finishing my masters in Biomedical Engineering at Tarbiat Modares University.
- ðŸŒ± I love learning cutting-edge technologies in my field.
- ðŸ§  My main passion lies in decoding (or rather coding) the neuroscience of sleep.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m on a quest to develop cutting-edge solutions to facilitate relaxation.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to biomedical engineering and neuroscience.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: sadaf.aram23@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have ADHD, so it's a minor miracle (or a major one) that I've survived this long in academia! ðŸ˜… (Being ridiculously competitive and my desire to leave a giant footprint in this world might have helped a bit.)
